CODE: PAL
DEF: Palette
DESC: Sets the palette if required
SYNTAX: PAL([hex],...)
EXAMPLE: PAL(abcdef,FF0000,FfFfFf)
NOTES: Should be done at start of scene

CODE: PNT
DEF: Paint
DESC: Paints a segment with a gradually-changing color
SYNTAX: PNT([from_color],[to_color],[from_idx/<end>],[to_idx/<end>])
EXAMPLES:
  PNT(ff0000,00ff00,start,end)  : Paint Red to Green, start (0) to end (var)
  PNT(0,2,0,end)                : Paint palette color #0 to #2, start to end
  PNT(abcdef,4,30,20)           : Paint color abcdef to pal #4, pos 30 down to pos 20
NOTES: Colors can be hex or palette #, positions can be index or "end"

CODE: STR
DEF: Stroke
DESC: Draws a single color along a segment
SYNTAX: STR([color],[from_idx/<end>],[to_idx/<end>])
EXAMPLES:
  STR(1,0,end)      : Draw color #1 from pos 0 to end
  STR(abcdef,5,10)  : Draw color abcdef from pos 5 to pos 10
NOTES: Color can be hex or palette #, positions can be index or "end"

CODE: ROT
DEF: Rotate
DESC: Rotate a layer in some direction at some speed
SYNTAX: ROT([direction:{0:UP,1:DOWN}],[delay])
EXAMPLES:
  ROT(0,200)     : Rotate up with a delay of 200ms/step
  ROT(DOWN,100)  : Rotate down with a delay of 100ms/step
NOTES: direction is int or str code, delay in ms

CODE: TWK
DEF: Twinkle
DESC: Twinkle a layer at some speed
SYNTAX: TWK([pattern:{0:UP,1:DOWN,2:RAND}],[delay])
EXAMPLES:
  TWK(0,10)      : Twinkle with upward propagation at 10ms/step
  TWK(DOWN,100)  : Twinkle with downward propagation at 100ms/step
  TWK(RAND,1000) : Twinkle with random propagation at 1000ms/step
NOTES:
  Pattern is int or str code, delay in ms. Propagation refers to the
  apparent direction of shadow drifting due to initial Perlin Noise
  setup pattern

CODE: LAY
DEF: Layer
DESC: Defines a layer
SYNTAX: LAY([draw commands...],[animate commands...])
EXAMPLES:
  LAY(PNT(FF32AE,3338FF,0,END),TWK(UP,200))  : Paint hot pink to cool blue, then twinkle at 200ms/step


CODE: PAN
DEF: Pan
DESC: Pans the viewport
SYNTAX: PAN([direction:{0:UP,1:DOWN}],[delay])
EXAMPLES:
  PAN(0,200)     : Pan up with a delay of 200ms/step
  PAN(DOWN,100)  : Pan down with a delay of 100ms/step
NOTES: direction is int or str code, delay in ms


FULL CODE EXAMPLES:
  - PAL(FF32AE,3338FF,000000),LAY(PNT(0,1,0,END),TWK(RAND,100)),LAY(STR(2,0,3),ROT(DOWN,10))
    Set palette to:
      #0 hot pink (FF32AE)
      #1 cool blue (3338FF)
      #2 black (000000)
    Create a layer:
      Paint hot pink to cool blue across strip length
      Twinkle with random pattern at 100ms/step
    Create a layer above:
      Stroke black from 0 to 3
      Rotate down at 10ms/step
